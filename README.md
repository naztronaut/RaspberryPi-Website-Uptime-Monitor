# Nazberry Pi - Website Uptime Monitor

**Note: This project is still a work in progress.**

The device monitors a list of your websites and lets you know if any of them are down. Still working on the logic but all green means all good. Red means 3+ sites are down, and yellow means 1-2 are down. More than one light can be on at once for now while I'm still figuring out the logic I want to implement.
